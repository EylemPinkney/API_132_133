Day 2

   1) Postman is used for manual API testing.
       2) We use RestAssured library for API Automation Testing.
       3) To type automation script fallow these steps:
           a) Understand the requirement
           b) Type test cases
               To type the test cases we use 'Gherkin Language'
               The keywords are:  x) Given: It is used for pre-condition
                                  y) When: It is used for actions(Requests...)
                                  z) Then: It is used for output(Assertion...)
                                  t) And:  It is used for multiple usage of Given, When and Then
           c) Starts to type Automation Script
               i) Set the URL -->This is not recommended. We'll spacify--We'll open a new class and
               ii) Set the expected data
               iii) Send the request and get the response
               iv) Do assertion

Day 3

We downloaded rest assured library. With this library we are able to "get()" request and we get a response after that request
In this response we have the data, that's coming from API. We are sending a request
Meta data means; It's the header part. Meta data is the data/information about the data. It's like we have a photo and
information about that photo is a meta data; like size, description.

To do test;

We need test framework; Junit, cucumber...
We put @Test
If I want to see something not found, this is a negative test
